1. Find the error in the following code and explain in few lines why it is wrong. (Score 1)
score 0.5, you missed that there two constructors that take same data types as inputs.
Because we have different arguments constructor/overload constructors, and the compiler will not build the default constructor in the Book class, so the Book Class must have a no-arg constructor, we have to build the no-arg constructor: 

like this:

public Book(){ // not required.
    //call superClass 
    super;
   //or set the default size
    size = 10;
}


2)the setter function is not right
Because it does not have really changed the parameter name

It will be fixed like this:

Public setName( String name){
	this.name = name; 
}

// score 1
The getTime() method return a wrong type, the return type should be String

It will be fixed like this:

String getTime(){
	return time;
}
